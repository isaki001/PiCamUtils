Steps
1. Run LIveCamTest.py to save an .png image that captures the empty parking lot
2. Make a configuration csv file with as many entries as you prefer
3. Run ConfigTest.py to check how far off the current configuration csv file from aligning with each parking spot

i.e. consider this config file
numblocks, originRow, originCol, length, width, spaceAmongblocks
5,40,55,27,10,4
5,80,100,27,10,5

which yields initialConfig.png

After updating a bit, we see why this is not an easy practical problem.
Unless the camera is at a perfectly straight angle, and unless the parking spot lines are all
on the same angle and consistent amongst themselves, the pixel bounds displayed will not align perfectly.

To make configuration easier, we add more blocks, allowing small inconsistencies
among them different blocks to not be important.
We can see an example at MoreBlocksNeeded.png

Thus we add additional blocks of parking spots for the same rows
The resulting config file is 10spotConfig.csv

On an empty parking spots these are the reported differences(if verbose is set to True)

When trying to identify the threshold, check the difference between a very recent image and a current one
with empty lot.
